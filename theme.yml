h2:
  # 'auto' is the default behavior. It attempts to avoid breaks but will allow if necessary.
  # 'avoid' makes a stronger attempt to avoid a page break before the heading.
  # 'always' forces a page break before the heading (which you might be experiencing implicitly).
  page_break_before: auto # Ensure it's not set to 'always' if you want to avoid new pages for H2s.

# General heading settings (applies to h1, h2, h3, etc. unless overridden)
heading:
  # Minimum number of lines of content to keep with a heading on the same page.
  # This helps prevent a heading from being stranded at the bottom of a page alone.
  keep_with_next_lines: 5 # You can increase this if you want more content to stick

# Prevent specific block types from breaking inside themselves
# Useful for tables, literal blocks (code), etc.
