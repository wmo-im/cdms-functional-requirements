==== Overview

Provide interactive capabilities for climate scientists, data managers, and operators to visualize, explore, and
analyze climate observation data and quality control results. The user interface enables efficient human interaction
with complex climate datasets and supports quality assurance workflows.

==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 identifies the Graphical User Interface for time-series data exploration as Recommended (Section 7.1),
supporting "tables and charts, visualization, manage content, integrated search of climate data, and data download."

While WMO-No. 1238 does not mandate specific UI requirements, it emphasizes the need for "climate scientists to review
and validate climate observations, identify inhomogeneities" and for "data managers to manage station metadata and
data holdings" (Figure 2), which requires appropriate user interfaces. The requirement for "comprehensive records" and
"quality control" workflows (3.3.2) implies interactive tools for human oversight.
