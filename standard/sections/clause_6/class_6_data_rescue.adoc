|Target type|Software system
|Dependency|/req/core, /req/data-ingestion
|Conformance test|/conf/data-rescue
|===

==== Overview

Facilitate the recovery of historical climate observations from non-digital sources, ensuring rescued data is
integrated into the climate record with complete provenance and appropriate quality control. Data rescue extends
the temporal coverage of climate records, essential for understanding long-term climate variability and change.

==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 classifies Data Rescue capabilities as Recommended (Section 5.2), covering "imaging and digitization,
monitoring, and data entry."

WMO-No. 1238 requires Members ensure "Entities develop a data rescue strategy" including "systematic" preservation
activities, digitization plans, and resource mobilization (3.5.3.1).

[NOTE]
====
The Guidelines on Good Practices for Data Rescue (WMO-No. 1182) emphasizes that data rescue is "the ongoing process of
identifying and preserving all data, records and climate archives that are at risk of being lost."

==== Requirements

[[rec_data_rescue_imaging]]
===== Document Imaging Management

[cols="1,4"]
|===
2+^|**Recommendation {counter:rec-id}**
|Identifier|/rec/data-rescue/imaging
|Statement a|
The system SHOULD support document imaging workflows including:

* Storage of scanned images with persistent identifiers
* Association of images with source document metadata (archive, collection, date range)
* Support for multiple image formats (JPEG, TIFF, PDF)
* Image quality metadata (resolution, color depth, scan date)
* Linkage between images and digitized observations

|===

[[rec_data_rescue_interface]]
===== Data Entry Interface

[cols="1,4"]
|===
2+^|**Recommendation {counter:rec-id}**
|Identifier|/req/data-rescue/data-entry
|A a|
The system SHOULD provide a data entry interface for manual keying that:

* Displays source images alongside data entry forms
* Supports configurable data entry templates based on historical form layouts
* Provides real-time validation of entered values
* Tracks data entry operator and timestamp
* Supports both single-key and double-key entry workflows for quality assurance

|===

[[req_data_rescue_qc]]
===== Data Rescue Quality Control

[cols="1,4"]
|===
2+^|**Requirement {counter:req-id}**
|Identifier|/req/data-rescue/quality-control
|Statement a|The system SHALL apply quality control to rescued data including:

* Comparison between double-key entries to identify transcription errors
* Range and consistency checks appropriate to historical observation practices
* Verification against original images when discrepancies are detected
* Flagging of uncertain or illegible values
* Documentation of data rescue quality assurance decisions

|===

[[req_data_rescue_provenance]]
===== Data Rescue Provenance

[cols="1,4"]
|===
2+^|**Requirement {counter:req-id}**
|Identifier|/req/data-rescue/provenance
|Statement a|
The system SHALL record data rescue provenance including:

* Source document identification and archive location
* Image identifier and scan metadata
* Data entry operator(s) and keying date(s)
* Keying method (single-key, double-key, automated OCR)
* Quality assurance verification status
* Known limitations or uncertainties in rescued data
