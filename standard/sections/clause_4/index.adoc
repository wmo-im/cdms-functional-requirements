// **Climate Data Management System (CDMS)**: A system designed for the quality control, homogenization,
// archival, and distribution of long-term climate observations with emphasis on temporal consistency and data provenance.

// **Homogenization**: The process of detecting and adjusting for non-climatic discontinuities in
// climate time series caused by changes in instrumentation, observation practices, station location, or surrounding environment.

// **Data Rescue**: The process of recovering historical climate data from non-digital sources (primarily paper records) through
// digitization, transcription, and quality assurance procedures.

// **Quality Control (QC)**: Systematic procedures to detect and flag erroneous, suspicious, or inconsistent observations
// to ensure data fitness for climate analysis.

// **Metadata**: Data about data, including information on station location, instrumentation, observation methods,
// data provenance, and processing history.

// **Data Lineage**: Documentation of the complete history and transformations applied to climate data from initial
// observation through archival.

//  Additional terms are defined in <<appendix>>.
