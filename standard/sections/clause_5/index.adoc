== Conventions

For the purposes of this document, the conventions described in this clause apply.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions (Requirements and Conformance Tests) in this module are denoted by URIs which follow a
hierarchical structure to ensure unique identification and traceability.

The base URI for this specification is:
`http://spec.wmo.int/spec/[spec-name]/[version]/[module-name]`

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by **partial URIs** which are relative
to this base.

The structure for partial URIs is defined as follows:

==== Requirements URIs

Requirements are identified by a URI fragment that includes the Requirements Class name and a unique identifier for
the specific requirement.

* **Format:** `/req/[requirements-class-name]/[requirement-id]`
* **Example:** `/req/quality-control/range-check`

==== Recommendation URIs

Recommendations are identified by a URI fragment that includes the Recommendations Class name and a unique identifier for
the specific requirement.

* **Format:** `/rec/[recommendation-class-name]/[recommendation-id]`
* **Example:** `/rec/homogenisation/detection`

====
DB comment: need to check the syntax.

==== Conformance Test URIs

Conformance Tests are identified by a URI fragment that includes the Conformance Class name and a unique identifier for
the test.

* **Format:** `/conf/[conformance-class-name]/[test-id]`
* **Example:** `/conf/quality-control/range-check`

=== Use of IETF RFC 2119 Keywords

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

The keywords indicate the level of strictness required for compliance with a normative provision:

* **MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL:** These keywords mean that the definition is an **absolute requirement** of the specification.
* **MUST NOT/SHALL NOT:** These phrases mean that the definition is an **absolute prohibition** of the specification.
* **SHOULD/RECOMMENDED:** These keywords mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore
a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* **SHOULD NOT/NOT RECOMMENDED:** These phrases mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
when the behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
weighed before proceeding.
* **MAY/OPTIONAL:** These keywords mean that an item is truly optional.

=== Typographical and Notational Conventions

The following typographical conventions are used throughout this document to distinguish different types of content:

* **`Monospace Text`**: Used for source code examples, file names, directory names, machine-readable data structures
(e.g., JSON keys, XML tags), URIs, and literal text that appears in a program or command line.
* **_Italics_**: Used for titles of documents, variable placeholders within code or URI templates, and for emphasis.
* **[Bracketed] Text**: Used for placeholders in this template (e.g., `[spec-name]`, `[module-name]`) that must be
replaced with specific content during implementation.
* **[NOTE], [TIP], [IMPORTANT]**: Used to highlight informative text blocks that provide context, advice, or warnings
that are **not** part of the normative requirements.
