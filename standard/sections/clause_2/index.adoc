== Conformance

This specification defines the following conformance classes that align with the major functional
containers shown in xref:c4_level_2[xrefstyle=short]:

- **Core Data Management** (Required): Basic observation storage, retrieval, and metadata management capabilities
- **Quality Control** (Required): Climate-specific QC procedures including range, temporal, spatial, and climatological checks
- **Data Ingestion** (Required): Multi-format data import, validation, and normalization
- **Data API** (Required): Standards-based data query, retrieval, and distribution interfaces
- **Homogenization** (Recommended): Statistical detection and adjustment of inhomogeneities in climate time series
- **Data Rescue** (Optional): Digitization workflow for historical paper records including imaging and data entry
- **Metadata Management** (Required): Comprehensive station metadata with full history and provenance tracking

Each conformance class is described in detail in subsequent sections, with corresponding test specifications
provided in <<test-specifications>>.

[NOTE]
====
The classification of conformance classes as Requirement, Recommendation and Permission aligns with the
Required, Recommended and Optional classifications respectively from WMO-No. 1131.
Required classes must be implemented for a system to be considered
conformant. Recommended classes should be implemented where operationally feasible. Optional classes
may be implemented based on specific organizational needs.
