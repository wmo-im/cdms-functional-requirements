==== Overview

Ensure the system is accessible, intuitive, and efficient for climate scientists, data managers, and operators
with varying levels of technical expertise. Usability directly impacts the effectiveness of quality control,
data validation, and metadata management workflows that depend on expert human judgment.

==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 emphasizes that CDMSs must support diverse user roles including "climate scientists, data managers,
system operators and data entry operators" (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The specification notes that while "most NMHSs
would not manage infrastructure and software required to support" certain advanced components, systems must still be "
flexible enough to accommodate national climate monitoring products and other national indices" (Section 4.4.2.3).

WMO-No. 1238 recognizes the need for "climate scientists to review and validate climate observations, identify
inhomogeneities" (Figure 2), which requires effective user interfaces. The Competencies requirements (3.6) acknowledge
that staff need appropriate training, implying systems should support learnable, efficient workflows.

==== Requirements

===== User Interface Design

===== Accessibility

[cols="1,4"]
|===
2+^|**Recommendation {counter:rec-id}**
|Identifier|/rec/usability/accessibility
|A a|The system user interface SHOULD conform to:

* Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA where applicable
* Support for screen readers and assistive technologies
* Sufficient color contrast for visual accessibility
* Text scaling without loss of functionality
