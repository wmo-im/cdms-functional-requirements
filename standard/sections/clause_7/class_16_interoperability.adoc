==== Overview

Ensure the system can exchange data and integrate with external systems using industry-standard protocols, formats,
and conventions. Interoperability enables climate data to flow seamlessly between national systems, regional centers,
international archives, and the WIS 2.0 infrastructure.

==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 emphasizes that "open spatial standards are a mechanism that is being increasingly adopted by many
organizations and industry sectors around the world" (Section 8.1) and that these standards are "expected to become an
increasingly important mechanism for distributing data in future years." The specification notes that standardized
delivery "will ensure that data are represented in a form that facilitates data interoperability and are accessible
to a wide range of end users from disparate industries" (Section 3.1.4.1).

WMO-No. 1238 requires "Members shall ensure that Entities encode data, and associated metadata, intended for
international exchange following the standards specified in the Manual on Codes (WMO-No. 306), the Manual on the WMO
Information System (WMO-No. 1060)" (3.2.2.1). The framework principle mandating registration in "the WIS Global
Discovery Catalogue" (1.1.1(4)) requires standards-based interoperability.

2+^|**Requirement {counter:req-id}**
|Identifier|/req/interoperability/api
|A a|The system API SHALL support interoperability through:

* Content negotiation using standard HTTP Accept headers
