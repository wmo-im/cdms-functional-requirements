==== Overview

Ensure proper stewardship of climate data through lifecycle management, quality documentation, access policies,
and compliance with organizational and regulatory requirements. Data governance provides the policy framework and
accountability structures necessary for long-term climate data stewardship.


==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 dedicates Chapter 3 entirely to "CDMS Governance," stating that "one of the steps often overlooked when
implementing a CDMS is to ensure that the NMHS has established a solid governance framework to protect the integrity of
the climate record" involving "Policies" and "Governance processes." The specification defines data governance as
Required (Section 3.2.1), including "controlled access to data and systems," "approval process for new data types,"
"approval process to change data," and "IT change approvals.".

WMO-No. 1238 requires "Members should ensure that Entities implement and maintain a governance mechanism to oversee the
various governance elements, coordinated by a governance body" (3.5.1.1) and mandates policies covering commitments,
sustainability, intellectual property, and data delivery (Section 3.1 of WMO-No. 1131). The framework emphasizes that
"data stewardship assigns to an entity rights and responsibilities for acquiring and managing climate data and
information" (Definitions), requiring formalized governance structures.
