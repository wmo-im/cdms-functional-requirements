==== Overview

Ensure the system can handle operational data volumes, concurrent users, and query loads efficiently while maintaining
acceptable response times and supporting future growth. Performance requirements ensure the CDMS remains viable as
data volumes increase and user communities expand over decades of operation.

==== Justification and Regulatory Basis

WMO-No. 1131 emphasizes that CDMSs must handle "big data" characterized by "large volumes of data in a variety of
formats that present challenges for effective data management" (Section 4.1). The specification notes systems must
manage "observation datasets spanning minimum 100 years of historical data" with scalability for "considerable amounts
of derived data" (Section 4.5).

WMO-No. 1238 requires systems support "duplicate repositories for the duration of their retention periods" (3.4.2.2)
and handle data from multiple Earth system domains (1.1.2), implying substantial performance requirements.
The framework principle of ensuring "adequate uniformity and standardization" (Introduction, para 5e) requires
consistent performance across implementations.
